- **vendor** directory is a special directory, which stores external packages; the usage is described below.
- **notes** directory has my notes; all notes (i.e., TeX documents) should be stored here.



External packages and Vendor directory
--------------------------------------

The codes in this repository depend on various external packages and tools, which are currently categorized as ``pip`` tools and ``submodule`` tools.

If the ``vendor`` directory has ``requirements.txt``, this repository depends on ``pip`` tools for Python codes.
One can install them by ``pip`` command,

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install -r vendor/requirements.txt

Note that this command installs the package to your *system*.
If you are not confident on what you are doing, it may be better to install one-by-one by reading ``requirements.txt``.
Using env-tools such as ``pipenv`` are also recommended, with which you can sequester the Python system for this package from the Python system for the whole machine by so-called virtualenv mechanism (e.g., ``pyenv-virtualenv``). For details, consult Google.

``submodule`` tools are linked to this repository via ``git-submodule`` mechanism, which is invoked by

.. code-block:: sh

   git submodule init
   git submodule update

and then the packages are automatically installed in ``vendor`` directory, after which one should compile those packages one by one.

``vendor/Makefile`` is provided to do the above all at once, but I do not guarantee if ``make`` works in your environment.
Rather, the ``Makefile`` is prepared to inform you which version of tools are used in this analysis and how they are compiled (possibly with patches).
